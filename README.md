# Custom Fuselage Shader

The purpose of this project was to rewrite the orignal fuselage shader in FlightGear to be more attractive and akin to the graphical style or a commercial simulator. The project is still incomplete and has many issues but as I learn and experiment further I hope to eliminate as many of these issues as possible.

### Installing

1) Download the project.
2) Open the Flightgear root folder.
3) Open the "NEW" folder.
4) Drag the "/Shaders" folder into "/data"

## Issues

* Lighting too bright at night
* Lightmap's currently not working
* Reflection's are static
* Normal Mapping not yet included

## Uninstalling

The folder labeled "NEW" contains the modified shader files. The folder labeled "OLD" contains the original shader files. Should you wish to revert back to the old shader files, simply repeat the Installation process but instead with the "OLD" folder.
