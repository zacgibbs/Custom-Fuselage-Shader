# Custom Fuselage Shader

The purpose of this project was to rewrite the orignal fuselage shader in FlightGear to be more attractive and akin to the graphical style or a commercial simulator. The project is still incomplete and has many issues but as I learn and experiment further I hope to eliminate as many of these issues as possible.

## Getting Started

* The folder labeled "NEW" contains the modified shader files.
* The folder labeled "OLD" contains the original shader files, should you wish to revert back to them.

### Installing

* Download the project.
* Open the Flightgear root folder.
* Open the "NEW" folder.
* Drag the "/Shaders" folder into "/data"

## Issues

* Lighting too bright at night
* Lightmap's currently not working
* Reflection's are static
* Normal Mapping not yet included
